#### üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏èüíºüè¨üåÜ I work at Samsung Electronics in Suwon. My current hobbies are **self hosting servers**, **trying various input device/methods**, **writing my own markdown journals**...  
  
Arch, ~~NixOS~~, Debian, Fedora, Windows, MacOS user.
If you were to ask me which OS is the best, I would say all of them.  
ü™üWindows, :tokyo_tower:Arch, :apple:Mac, :snowflake:NixOS, :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:TIZEN, everything.  
  
I wish to do more projects about:  
1. Quantum Computing  
2. Physical UIs (with MCU and MPUs)  
3. Market Understanding  
4. Reinforcement Learning/Game Simulation (More of strategic games than video games)

[How to add the widgets to your GitHub page.](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/readme.md "This feature is based on an app that runs on the OP's personal server. His server runs into traffic problems sometimes. If the `demo` is not showing up well, the server must be down. Go to the Deploy on your own Vercel instance section and deploy your own app to use it independently. This will require you to fork or clone the repository. I cloned the repositry and pushed it as a private repo of mine to use the source independently.")
