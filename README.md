*This feature is based on an app that runs on the OP's personal server. His server runs into traffic problems sometimes.*  
*If the `demo` is not showing up well, the server must be down. Go to the **Deploy on your own Vercel instance section** and deploy your own app to use it independently. This will require you to fork or clone the repository.*
*I cloned the repositry and pushed it as a private repo of mine to use the source independently.*
